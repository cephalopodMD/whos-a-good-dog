### Gameplay

**Overview**

The goal of *Who's a Good Dog* is to destroy as much of your owner's house as possible without getting caught. To cause financial damage, the player can poop and interact with various objects in each level. Some objects can be destroyed, giving the player points immediately, while others may be used in various ways to hide the poop from the owner or to amplify the damage caused by the poop.

**Controls**

- Arrow keys - move
- Q/Z - poop
- W/X - interact

**Interactions**

The user can interact with any object which has a gray square in front of it. The effect of the interaction varies based on the object, varying from ripping up a bed to burning poop in a stove. The player should explore how different interactions help them succeed in destroying the house.
